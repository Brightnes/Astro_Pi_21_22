# Astro_Pi_21_22
Code and other stuff for Astro Pi 21/22 Mission Space Lab activity.

plotting_code_01.py code uses matplotlib to plot numerical data vs time. 
You have to enter the proper line number to get the plot. 
The code will output an error with non float data (i.e. sun altitude, azimuth or boolean values) but that's okay, good job for future days.

astrob_plotting_two_trajct.py code gets lat-long values from two data sets and plots the trajectories together.
Passes above the same coordinates are at intersections.
